    In the realm of the web, I am a star<br />

    a charm<br />
    And with <span class="text-yellow">C++</span>, I solve problems that seem so
    alarm<br />
    My code is clean, efficient and secure<br />
    And version control with <span class="text-yellow">Git</span> keeps my code
    pure<br />
    <br /><br />
    With <span class="text-yellow">MongoDB</span> or
    <span class="text-yellow">Postgres</span>, your data is well-saved<br />
    And <span class="text-yellow">Redis</span> ensures performance, nothing is
    enslaved<br />
    With <span class="text-yellow">Nginx</span> and

    stand out like dew<br />
    But I am not just a coder, I'm a funny person too<br />
    I'll make you laugh with jokes, even when your code is blue<br />
